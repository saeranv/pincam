## pincam-simple
A simple pinhole camera library developed in Numpy, used mainly for educational purposes. 

It computes a camera projection matrix to transform 3D geometries to 2D geometries, and incorporates a simple raycasting method to resolve depth order for overlapping geometries. Visualization is then achieved using geopandas.


### Example
Visualizating some geometries:
