## Pincam
A simple pinhole camera library in Python. 

Pincam computes a camera projection matrix that projects 3D geometries onto a defined camera image plane. It incorporates a simple raycasting method to resolve depth order for geometries relative to the image plane. The geometries are stored in a geopandas DataFrame, which facilitates easy plotting and customization of the geometries for further visualization and analysis. 

For example, here's a simple analysis I did at work with Pincam and geopandas to calculate surface solar insolation:

Note, that while the camera projection library scales well, the raycasting method to resolve depth order doesnâ€™t. A more robust 3D visualization framework is thus recommended for complex visualization. Pincam is really more of a toy library.   

### Examples
An example project showing the visualization of three surfaces with a heading and pitch of 15 degrees, and focal length of 25 mm:

Using Pincam to show how camera projection works, here we see how 3D geometries are scaled by depth within the camera view frustum:

These examples can be seen in the quickstart.ipynb and view_frustrum.ipynb notebooks, in the notebooks directory.
