Lightweight Pinhole Camera (WIP)

### Potential Applications
- 3d geometry visualization in matplotlib/geopandas
- View Factor calculations:
    - proportion of area of polygons in an image with a 180 FOV = planar view factor
    - proportion of area of polygons in a spherically distributed set of cameras = 
	point view factor
- Integrate with OSM and Google Street View API to 

### Examples
Visualizating some geometries:

Using camera parameters from the Google Street View camera to map OSM geometries 
to street view images:
